# Energy Transitions Project Overview

This project focuses on exploring energy transitions, particularly in Lithuania and the Baltic region, along with a global perspective. Utilizing Plotly.js, interactive visualizations depict energy-related data, offering insights into consumption, production, critical materials, and transition trends over time.

## Structure
The project data undergoes analysis in Jupyter Notebooks, where it's processed, visualized, and transformed into interactive insights before being transferred to HTML for presentation. 

- **Data Analysis**: Raw energy-related datasets are explored, cleaned, and processed within Jupyter Notebooks.
  
- **Visualization**: Interactive visualizations depicting energy trends for Vilnius, Klaipeda, and Panevezys are created using tools like Plotly.js.
  
- **Insight Generation**: Insights into energy consumption, production, and transition trends are derived through statistical analysis and data visualization techniques.
  
- **HTML Output**: The processed data and visualizations are rendered into HTML documents, allowing for easy viewing and interaction by users.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: The project uses Plotly.js to create dynamic and interactive visualizations, which distinguishes it from simpler static presentations and adds a layer of technical sophistication.
- **Full-Stack Web Development**: The combination of Django for backend development with HTML and Bootstrap for the frontend involves both development and deployment challenges, showcasing a broad range of skills.
- **Regional Focus with Global Perspective**: By focusing on energy transitions in Lithuania and the Baltic region while also providing a global context, the project offers a unique blend of local and international insights.
- **Django Web Application**: Incorporating a Django-based newsletter subscription system adds an interactive user engagement component, demonstrating practical web development skills and enhancing user interaction.

## Django Integration: Newsletter Subscription
To engage with the audience interested in energy transitions, this project includes a Django-based newsletter subscription feature. Users can subscribe to an "Energy Newsletter" to receive updates on the project's progress and insights.

### Django Project Overview
Newsletter Subscription Model: A simple model to store subscriber information (name and email) is created using Django.

Form Handling: Users can input their details through a form that is processed and saved to the database.
